# Minecraft on wayland:
 - Turn on use system installation of GLFW (Setting->Minecraft->Tweaks)
 # Brigthness keys not working
 - Cause: my keys are not detected by wayland, only with acpid
 - Solution: trigger bctl in acpid/map using ydotool? 
 # Discord
 - Why don't use default client - https_proxy not working
